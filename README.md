#  Mini ATM Project using Python & Tkinter

##  Project Overview

This is a beginner-friendly **Graphical User Interface (GUI)-based ATM simulation** created using Python and Tkinter. The application allows users to:
- Create an account (username & password)
- Login with hidden password input and toggle visibility
- Deposit money
- Withdraw money
- Check account balance

The project is an excellent practice exercise for building logic in Python, integrating GUI, and handling user interactions securely.

## Case Study

### Problem:
A user-friendly desktop ATM interface is required for managing simple banking operations like deposits, withdrawals, and checking balance. It should include login authentication with password visibility toggle for better UX.

### Solution:
This project uses Python and Tkinter to simulate ATM behavior:
- Users must first create and verify their credentials.
- Upon successful login, they are presented with a menu of operations.
- Password is hidden by default, but can be toggled to visible using an "eye" button.
- The session ends after the selected transaction is complete.
